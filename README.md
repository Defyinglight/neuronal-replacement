# neuronal-replacement
The objective of this project is to investigate the impact of node replacement on the performance and behavior of a simple neural network. Specifically, I aim to understand how replacing nodes affects the network's accuracy and identify any patterns in how different types of nodes influence these changes. Additionally, I seek to explore whether these alterations lead to a change in the 'identity' of the network, as defined by its functions and behavior.

# Inspiration
The inspiration for this project comes from the movie "Ghost in the Shell," which delves into the concept of a 'ghost'â€”an essence that defines individual identity. The film poses captivating questions about the nature of identity and self, particularly when all physical components are replaceable. This led me to ponder: if you replace parts of a neural network, does it still maintain its 'identity'? Are you really still 'you' if all your body parts are mechanical, but your brain remains? This project aims to explore these questions on a smaller scale, using neural networks as a simplified model to investigate the impact of node replacement on network behavior and identity.
