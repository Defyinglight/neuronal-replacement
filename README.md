# Obj
The objective of this project is to investigate the impact of node replacement on the performance and behavior of a simple neural network. Specifically, I aim to understand how replacing nodes affects the network's accuracy and identify any patterns in how different types of nodes influence these changes. Additionally, I seek to explore whether these alterations lead to a change in the 'identity' of the network, as defined by its functions and behavior.

Technical Objectives.
To understand how the performance and behavior of a simple neural network are influenced by the replacement of nodes.
To quantify the changes in network performance metrics, such as accuracy and loss, before and after node replacement.

Philosophical Objectives.
To investigate whether the concept of 'identity' is maintained or altered when nodes in a neural network are replaced.
To explore parallels between the project's findings and broader questions about identity and replaceable components, inspired by themes in "Ghost in the Shell."

Practical Objectives.
To develop an algorithm for node replacement that is easy to implement and test.
To comprehensively document the project, offering insights that could be valuable for future research in machine learning or philosophy of mind.

# Inspiration
The inspiration for this project comes from the movie "Ghost in the Shell," which delves into the concept of a 'ghost'â€”an essence that defines individual identity. The film poses captivating questions about the nature of identity and self, particularly when all physical components are replaceable. This led me to ponder: if you replace parts of a neural network, does it still maintain its 'identity'? Are you really still 'you' if all your body parts are mechanical, but your brain remains? This project aims to explore these questions on a smaller scale, using neural networks as a simplified model to investigate the impact of node replacement on network behavior and identity.
